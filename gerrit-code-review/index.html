      <h2>How and why we use Gerrit</h2>
    </header>
    <section class="post-content">
      

<p>At work, we&rsquo;ve been long-time users of Gerrit for code review. We recently started a new project with a new team and had an opportunity to reevaluate that choice against other workflows, particularly Github Pull Requests.</p>

<h2 id="collectivist-approach:0b6ff0d9ba793c0b3d72c6f18fa96d4a">Collectivist Approach</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a strong believer in a collective approach to team decision making (you could call it the anarchist (with a capital &ldquo;A&rdquo;), but that freaks people out). Particularly around tooling, leaders should not be perscriptive. We should, together, pick the tools that work for us. I <em>prima facie</em> reject being told what tools our team will use, and avoid demanding teams use particular tools whenever possible. (This applies equally to security teams as well as development teams, although I&rsquo;m talking about development teams here.)</p>

<p><img src="/images/hippies.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Part of the collective approach is that code review should be done one a peer-to-peer basis, rather than by a chief programmer. A code review process which everyone buys into will be mutally supportive and has been show to be effective at stopping bugs early. A top-down code review process tends towards the demoralizing and the oppressive.</p>

<p>It is in this context that we set out to decide how we were going to work on this new project.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-want:0b6ff0d9ba793c0b3d72c6f18fa96d4a">What we want</h2>

<p>In the course of the discussion about code review, we have come to realize that we want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code review to happen before code is merged (pre-commit).</li>
<li>Support for revising changes.</li>
<li>Workflow support that makes review efficient.</li>
<li>A clean commit history.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/gerrit_workflow.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="vs-printout-review:0b6ff0d9ba793c0b3d72c6f18fa96d4a">vs. Printout Review</h2>

<p>We could have built a process around <em>printout review</em> (my term) where we get together and look at the code as a whole every once in a while. There are some people advocating for this and some tools that support it (you can do it with GitHub comments, for example).</p>

<p>We reject this approach because it is <a href="http://smartbear.com/SmartBear/media/pdfs/11_Best_Practices_for_Peer_Code_Review.pdf">too time consuming and not suficiently effective</a> at finding bugs.</p>

<p>Before a commit has landed you still have plenty of time to discuss coding choices, make small suggestions, and so on. With printout review, there is inertia preventing even small changes.</p>

<p>And small changes matter. Getting names consistent &amp; descriptive allows a large codebase to be immediately understood. Getting spelling and whitespace correct makes the codebase grepable and inspires confidence.</p>

<h2 id="vs-pull-requests:0b6ff0d9ba793c0b3d72c6f18fa96d4a">vs. Pull Requests</h2>

<p>Revising a change before it lands is an important part of our process. The general workflow of a change is something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>You write some code.</li>
<li>You ask for a review.</li>
<li>The reviewer makes some comments</li>
<li>You make some changes.</li>
<li>You ask for a second review.</li>
<li>The reviewer gives a thumbs up.</li>
<li>The code is merged.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Github Pull Request workflow seems to be based on the idea that steps 4 and 5 are rare. It assumes that changes will not routinely be modified after their initial review.</p>

<p>We found that we were revising commits <strong>constantly</strong>. So with pull requests we&rsquo;d have a feature branch like:</p>

<pre><code>REVXXXX1 frob: adjust the grob to be more grobular
REVXXXX2 fix review comments
REVXXXX3 fix typos
</code></pre>

<p>And each of those revisions would have a few comments here and there.</p>

<p>Of course we don&rsquo;t want <code>REVXXXX2</code> and <code>REVXXXX3</code> in the commit history, so we&rsquo;d squish the commits into one before we merged them. And when we squish the history <em>poof!</em> our comments are gone.</p>

<p><img src="/images/gerrit_github.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the screenshot above we see a change made using the pull request flow. There are three commits: an initial change (not shown) and two revisions in response to comments (yellow box). The final commit (red box) is a squished commit combining the three previous. Inline comments from the intermediate changes are lost.</p>

<p>We discovered that we need first-class support for revising changes. With pull requests revisions are clumsy at best.</p>

<h2 id="gerrit:0b6ff0d9ba793c0b3d72c6f18fa96d4a">Gerrit</h2>

<p>Next we tried Gerrit. Revising a change very easy and natural. In Gerrit each change has a number of revisions and the revision of changes is a first-class concept.</p>

<p><img src="/images/gerrit_gerrit.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We have found the using Gerrit promotes a lot of nice things:</p>

<ul>
<li>We get reasonable commit history.</li>
<li>Our code is easy to read because continuity errors get fixed. (i.e. &ldquo;You called it a <code>FrobServer</code> over there but here it is <code>frob_handler</code>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Our master branch is <del>always</del> usually working.</li>
<li>Reviews happen quickly because people know what to review.</li>
<li>The tools are easy (once you get used to &lsquo;em).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="review-workflow:0b6ff0d9ba793c0b3d72c6f18fa96d4a">Review Workflow</h2>

<p>Code review works much better when reviews can happen quickly. We were getting slowed down by spending a lot of time tracking the state of various reviews. &ldquo;Are you ready for be to review 174 yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We discovered that our changes were in one of just a few states:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Not Ready</strong> - changes that were pushed for backup or other non-review reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Work In Progress</strong> - a partially commited change where the author wanted early feedback</li>
<li><strong>Ready for Review</strong> - complete work that needs review.</li>
<li><strong>Needs Revision</strong> - reviewed work that needs changed before it is merged.</li>
<li><strong>Ready to Merge</strong> - work that is reviewed and ready to go.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we tried GitHub, we used labels like <code>needs-review</code> and <code>needs-refactor</code> to indicate the state of a PR. This was natural, although we found reviewers were forgetting to set <code>needs-refactor</code> after doing a review. This was slightly forced, but certainly workable.</p>

<p>With Gerrit the labels scheme fits this approach very naturally. As is typical for Gerrit, we use the built-in <code>Code-Review</code> label set to <em>+2</em> for ready to merge. We created a custom label <code>Ready</code> with the following meaning:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>-1</em> - broken, please ignore</li>
<li><em>0</em> - not ready for review</li>
<li><em>+1</em> - work in progress, feedback requested</li>
<li><em>+2</em> - ready for final review</li>
</ul>

<p>From the Gerrit reviwers and authors can easily understand what work is waiting for them:</p>
